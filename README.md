Hi!

I am a student at UNC-Chapel Hill studying Journalism and Computer Science. This may seem an odd combination, but works really well to blend my interests in technology and the media. Blending both areas of study has led me to learn web development/design, data analytics for the news and other things. During the course of my senior year, I will be working on projects to improve my skills on the web and with data.
